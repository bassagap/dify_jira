# Introduction to Testus Patronus

Welcome to the Testus Patronus workshop! This hands-on tutorial is designed for the EuroSTAR Software Testing Conference, where you'll learn how to build your own AI assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a focus on software testing use cases.

## What You'll Learn

In this workshop, you'll learn to:
- Ingest product requirements, test cases, and technical documentation into a pre-configured RAG stack
- Customize the AI assistant to support your testing workflows
- Understand the theory behind RAG
- Set up and configure your own chatbot
- Ingest custom knowledge
- Adjust parameters for accuracy and relevance
- Use AI to explore product context, generate test cases, and answer technical questions
